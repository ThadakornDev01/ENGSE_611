            <h1>Modern CSS Features</h1>
            <p>
                Modern CSS has introduced a variety of features that enhance web design and development. These features include CSS Grid, Flexbox, custom properties 
                (CSS variables), and media queries for responsive design. They allow developers to create complex layouts, ensure consistency across designs, and adapt 
                to different screen sizes with ease.
            </p>

            <p>
                CSS Grid provides a two-dimensional layout system, enabling the creation of grid-based designs. Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout model for arranging 
                items in rows or columns. Custom properties allow for reusable values throughout the stylesheet, improving maintainability. Media queries facilitate responsive 
                design by applying different styles based on device characteristics such as screen width.
            </p>

                1914 translation by H. Rackham
                "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound 
                the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, 
                but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires 
                to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, 
                which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure 
                that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
